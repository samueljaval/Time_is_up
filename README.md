# Time's up!

Easy to use command line application to play Time's up with friends. 
All you need to do is compile and run the cpp script (or download the executable in the bin directory). 

The rules are the following :
There are two team of about the same number of people. Players take turns at trying to make their team guess what the word is. 
When a player is playing, they should be the only player looking at the computer. 
Players keep taking turns until the round is over. Each player's turn usually is 45sec (can make it whatever you want). The round is over whenever there aren't any words left. 
There are 3 rounds overall :
- In the first round, the player tries to make their team guess the word by describing it without saying the word. 
- In the second round, the player tries to make thier team guess the word by using only one word to describe it. 
- In the third round, the player tries to make their team guess the word by miming it. 

The words are the same at each round, so players should try to remember what they are to make the next round easier.
